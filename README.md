Assessment Studio Pro
=====================

# Introduction

Dear Mendix Studio Pro Developer,

This assessment is intended to give insights on your coding and logical thinking skills. So please treat this assignment the same as working for Mendix.

This assessment consists of a backlog with three User Stories that need to be implemented. You are also asked to present your results and findings on a laptop. We can provide a laptop if needed. 

After your presentation we will have a discussion about your results so we can understand your reasoning, chosen methodologies and technology while working on the User Stories.

Please treat this exercise as confidential so that we can reuse it for any future candidates.

If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to contact us.

_Before starting your assignment, please run `git init && git add . && git commit -am "initial commit"` so that we can track your changes from the base line._

Good luck and enjoy!
